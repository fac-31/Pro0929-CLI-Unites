## 🧪 Testing

The following scenarios have been tested:
- ✅ Fresh installation from source
- ✅ Package reinstallation with `uv pip install -e '.[test]'`
- ✅ CLI commands working after symlink fix
- ✅ Onboarding flow with team setup
- ✅ Note creation and retrieval
- ✅ Rich styling and formatting working correctly
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## 📋 Installation Instructions (Updated)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fac-31/Pro0929-CLI-Unites.git
cd Pro0929-CLI-Unites
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e '.[test]'

# Fix for editable install issue
ln -sf $(pwd)/notes_wrapper.py .venv/bin/notes
```

## 🔄 Workarounds for Developers

If the symlink gets overwritten during reinstalls:
```bash
uv pip install -e '.[test]'
ln -sf $(pwd)/notes_wrapper.py .venv/bin/notes
```

Alternative: Run CLI directly without entry point:
```bash
python -m cli_unites.cli --help
```
